I am **Rahul Dev Sharma**, a recent graduate in Physics from *Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh*, with a strong focus on **quantum information science** and **computational physics**. My research interests revolve around the resources that make quantum computation possible—ranging from **fundamental measures like magic in spin systems**, to **structural resources such as cluster states**, and **practical frameworks in error correction and quantum machine learning**.  

I am currently exploring quantum information, and many body physics through collaborative research opportunities with scientists from institutions such as **TU Dresden**, **NYU Abu Dhabi**. My work focuses on problems spanning quantum magic and QML.

I am actively seeking opportunities for **MS or PhD studies** in quantum information science and computational physics.

## Current Research  

- 🔹 **Quantum Magic in Spin Systems** – exploring resource-theoretic measures of non-stabilizerness
- 🔹 **Learning with Topologically Protected Qubits** – applying **toric code states** to quantum machine learning

Beyond quantum information, I have co-authored a publication in *Astronomy & Astrophysics* [link](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202453239) on massive elliptical galaxies using strong lensing.

## Research Vision  

My goal is to bridge **theory, computation, and practical frameworks** to understand how quantum resources can be identified, preserved, and exploited for **scalable quantum advantage**. Looking ahead, I am actively seeking **MSc/PhD opportunities** to expand my work in **quantum information science and computation**, with openness to applications in computational physics.
